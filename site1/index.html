        <h1><center>Artificial Intelligence</center></h1>
        <h2><center>The innovation towards developing digital brains</center></h2>
        <p><center>Computer systems have been contributing to society since their incursion, however one notable (and perhaps more recent) innovation that will closely affect each of our lives is the introduction of artificial intelligence.</center></p>
        <h3><center><u>What is AI?</u></center></h3>
        <p><center>AI [short for Artificial Intelligence] is a concept involving programming a machine to learn as well as respond do its surroundings, similar to a human. This can be achieved through several different methods, including:</center></p>
        <u1>
        <li>Machine Learning - Where a machine is told to make decisions depending on what it has previously experienced. This may be used for analysing patterns in data.</li>
        <ul></ul> <!-- adds padding (space)-->
        <li>Neural Networks - As can be seen from the name, this is where a machine imitates the neurons in a human brain, and learns the correct answer to a problem for minimising a loss function. </li>
        <u1></u1>
        <p style = "width:50px;"><center>[The inner workings of a neural network can be quite complex at first glance. A more detailed insight can be found

        </center>
        </p>
        <ul></ul>
        <li>Genetic Evolution - An optimisation algorithm used to find the most effective solution to a problem (each epoch being a new instance of the solution).</li>
        <u1></u1>

        <ul></ul>
        <h5><center><i>[Above is a cool example illustrated by 'Tech With Tim', showing how genetic evolution can be used to teach an AI how to play Flappy Bird!]</i></center></h5>
        <h3><center><u>How has this improved society?</u></center></h3>
        <p>The development of AI has allowed for the concept to be integrated into virtually all branches of society, both social, political and even environmental. Ultimately, the inception of AI was to allow for the populous to live more efficient lives, as well as to simplify problems we may otherwise face. Traditional examples include:</p>
        <li>Self-Driving Automobiles -> Allows for driving without human error.</li>
        <p style="float: right; position: relative; top: -50px"><img src="ai-car.PNG" height="auto" width="207px"></p>
        <u1></u1>
        <li>Recommended tabs on entertainment services / social media.</li>
        <u1></u1>
        <li>NPCs in computer games.</li>
        <u1></u1>
        <li>Voice assistants (E.G Siri or Alexa)</li>
        <p>The true potential of AI goes far beyond this, however. More importantly, it is also used for diagnosis in healthcare, such as health monitoring, enhanced security, as well as improved quality. It is evident that the innovations regarding artifical intelligence will optimise both our social and political landscape, as well as maximising efficiency in solving problems previously percieved to only be solved through the eyes of a human, and certainly not a machine.</p>
