    <p>HTML, or Hyper-text Markup Language, is a programming language used in the creation of webpages. First written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, it is now on its fifth iteration, and has evolved to become closely intertwined with other languages such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) and JavaScript. HTML functions as the most bare-bones part of the website, giving the layout and fundamentals of the page. CSS is used to make the page more asethetically appealing, changing things such as fonts, background colour, text colour, and alignment. JavaScript adds much greater functionality to webpages, allowing them to be interactive to a much greater degree, allowing for a much more fluid and enjoyable user experience.<br> HTML, CSS and JS are examples of high-level languages. This means that they are written in a way that makes them easily legible to humans, but cannot be understood by a computer. In order for this code to be readable, it must first be translated into machine code. For websites, this is often done using an interpreter. This is because a web page may be accessed by many different devices and operating systems, so sending a compiled version of the code would not work as it would not fuction on all devices. Instead, the source code can be accessed from the server and interpreted by the client device. This means that as long as the client device has an interpreter, the webpage will be functional on any device.</p>
