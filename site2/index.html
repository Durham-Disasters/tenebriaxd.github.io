	<h1><center><u>DION Systems</u></center></h1>
	<p><center>The current development tools are very limited and painful to use. They lack clarity, have disorganization that grows out of control and are often a pain to use for tasks that should be relatively simple such as renaming a variable.</center></p>
	<h2><center><u>Why don't we have better tools ?</u></center></h2>
	<p><center>Currently, every form of programming has embraced the digital text format and over the decade that it has been around, the tools to edit this format have only become margainly better than the first few generations.</center></p>
	<p><center>This lack of improvement is due to the use of text files being fully explored.</center></p>
	<p><center>But what if there was another format ?</center></p>
	<h2><center><u>The DION format</u></center></h2>
	<p><center>The DION format is a new way of formatting code such that it is much easier to handle editor tools such as intellisense. It is able to accomplish this by seperating the text format that the user interacts with and the underlying source code format:</center></p>

	<h2><center><u>How will this improved society ?</u></center></h2>
	<p><center>DION should improve the productivity of programming by having far better development tools and should help improve code organization as a whole.</center></p>
